# Capstone 1: Proposal

These aren't really in any particular order but I'm kind of more excited about 1 and 3. The more I think about it, the less I want to do option 2.

### Option 1:
* [NYC Parking Violations](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2019/faiq-9dfq) - For this, I could look into what areas have the highest number of tickets or if tickets are given more often to a certain type of car. This one would also just be cool because if I can get the coordinates of the cross streets/addresses, I can do a geoplot.

### Option 2:

Data from DC's Procurement Automated Support System (PASS) datasets:
* [Payments](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/e08160211e394d9eadbfee515a9856b1_17)
* [Purchase Orders](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/purchase-orders-from-pass)
* [Contracts](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/contracts-from-pass/data)
* [Solicitations](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/solicitations-from-pass) - Still trying to figure out how to join this table to either contracts or purchase orders. I sent them a message for more information, but if I don't hear back I might have to leave this out.
* [Forecasts](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/forecast-from-pass/data) - I'm not sure what this represents, so I asked about this as well. It seems like it is what we consider purchase requests which would come before solicitations in the procurement process.

### Option 3:

* [Health Insurance Cross Sell](https://www.kaggle.com/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction?select=train.csv) - I think I can do bayesian testing with the response rate broken out by different categories (similar to what we did with click rates in class). Or maybe I can look at the difference in means of one or more of the continuous variables by the response variable.
